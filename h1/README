Due Mon Sept 29th.

This program implements an ID3-like decision-tree learner for classification.

-Each function runs a specific part of the algorithm
-Unit test each function to be sure it runs correctly
-Think about possible edge cases already brought up in class -- at least test those
-Figure out additional test cases that need to be considered


PLAN:
1-figure out complete algorithm that I'll run in pseudo-code
2-apply each part of the algorithm, and as I apply each part, create a corresponding unit test that will confirm that part is accurate


-ARFF reads like a database schema & table (very similar)

@relation <relation-name> == like a table name

 @attribute <attribute-name> <datatype> == like columns

 The <datatype> can be any of the four types supported by Weka:
1-numeric
2-integer is treated as numeric
3-real is treated as numeric

<nominal-specification>
string
date [<date-format>]
relational for multi-instance data (for future use)
where <nominal-specification> and <date-format> are defined below. The keywords numeric, real, integer, string and date are case insensitive.

--this homework seems very specific (it doesnt seem I need to think much out of the box other than how i apply the equations)

--use this as a chance to internalize important equations.
