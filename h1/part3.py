# Investigate how predictive accuracy varies as a function of tree size. 
# For both of the data sets considered in Part 2, you should learn trees using 
# the entire training set. Plot curves showing how test-set accuracy varies 
# with the value m used in the stopping criteria. Show points for m = 2, 5, 10 
# and 20. Be sure to label the axes of your plots.
